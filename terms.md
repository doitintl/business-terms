Between DoiT SaaS LTD (also doing business as "DoiT International" and "DoiT International USA, Inc) and you [customer name]:

Summary:
We’ll always do our best to fulfil your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What we do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;
You ([customer-name]), located at [customer-address] are hiring DoiT International located at Rav Aluf David Elazar 12 Tel-Aviv, ISRAEL to provide you with cloud computing consulting and support, including cost optimization in exchange for being your reseller as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

What do both parties agree to do?
You: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll give us everything we need to provide you with our support and consulting as and when and in the format we need it. You’ll review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule.

Us: We have the experience and ability to provide you with public cloud consulting and support and we’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. We’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.

**Consulting & Support**
From time to time, we will provide you with cloud engineering advice as per your request. You agree to request advice or support using our support.doit-intl.com portal which we have crafted exactly for this purpose. We will allocate a consultant from our staff as we see fit to the matter of issue at hand. You’ll have multiple opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. Both consulting and support are given for free unless stated otherwise elsewhere. 

**Professional Services**
You may hire us to perform a work on your behalf. It may be to develop something for you or migrate your workload from one platform to another. We will bill you at the end of each month on the time we have spent working on your task/s.

If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the direction our work is taking, you’ll pay us in full for everything we’ve produced until that point and cancel this contract.

**Payments**
We’re sure you understand how important it is for our business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As we’re also sure you’ll want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to our standard net+30 payment schedule. 

In case of continued non-payment, terminated accounts are at risk of being transferred to a third party collections agency, solely at out discretion. Please note that a third party collections agency may impose additional charges. Failure to pay may also result in us pursuing you legally to recover the value owed thus incurring further legal costs for your company.  

**Legal stuff**
We can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Just like a parking ticket, you can’t transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of Israeli courts.
